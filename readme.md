## Description
WordPress is developing fast - this also applies to the design of the backend. 
So it is important not to use your own styles in the admin area and use tags and classes of WordPress. 
This is the best way you can simplify your work as a developer and you don't have to test the design with every update. 
Unfortunately, there are quite extensive opportunities in the backend to implement the requirements. 
Several different classes and HTML structures are used. To be able to look up something this simple, 
I have developed this small Plugin, which tinkers in the development environment and quickly represents the necessary elements. 

Also see the [post](http://wpengineer.com/2226/new-plugin-to-style-your-plugin-on-wordpress-admin-with-default-styles/) 
about the idea and also the comments for a discussion.
